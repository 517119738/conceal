          <p>Why should I use care about this?</p>
          <p>
            As the Android platform gains popularity, it will become an
            attractive target for malware developers. Malware and Spyware put user's
            data at risk. We believe that safeguarding user's data against
            spyware and malware is very important for user trust.
            </p>
            At Facebook, we've been using Conceal for a while now to encrypt data on SD cards. 
            We think that other developers also believe in this goal, however are deterred by
            the impact of encryption on old phones. We've released this library so that every
            app can protect user data in an efficient manner. We also want to get the
            community involved to further improve the security and efficiency this library.

          <p>How can I contribute?</p>
          <p>
            We're actively looking for contributions to the project on        
            <a href="http://facebook.github.io/conceal/">Github</a>.
            Feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How can I reproduce these benchmark results?</p>
          <p>
            The benchmarks we've shown compare the Android system 
            provided libraries (AES-CTR-HMAC-SHA1, since it doesn't provide GCM), 
            Bouncycastle (AES-GCM) and Conceal (AES-GCM) run on a Galaxy Y.
            Our benchmarks are written using the
            <a href="https://code.google.com/p/caliper/">Caliper</a> framework
            and can be reproduced on real devices with the help of
            <a href="https://code.google.com/p/vogar/">Vogar</a>.
            <br>
            To run the benchmarks you must have BUCK installed as a pre-requisite.
            Connect your device to your computer and then you can then invoke the
            benchmarks from our repo.
            <br/><br/>
            For example, to invoke the read benchmark for a 100KB plaintext load,
            you can use:
            {% include benchmark_command.html %}
            <h5>An aside on KitKat</h5>
            Conceal predates Jellybean 4.3. On KitKat, Android changed the provider
            for cryptographic algorithms to OpenSSL. The default Cipher stream however
            still does not perform well. When replaced with our Cipher stream 
            (see BetterCipherInputStream), the default implementation is competitive
            against Conceal. On older phones, Conceal is faster than the system provided
            libaries. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Why aren't you using the OpenSSL version provided by Android?</p>
          <p>
            Conceal makes use of AES-GCM mode which is not available
            on the versions of OpenSSL that ship with old Android phones.
            The major issue with the stock OpenSSL is just too large for
            any app to even consider including it in an APK.
            By shipping only certain encryption libraries of OpenSSL we 
            reduce the size of the compiled binary and can also support
            Android versions from Froyo.
            The size of the armeabi-v7a version is 85KB.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Can I build a version with only the encryption libraries of OpenSSL on my own?</p>
          <p>
            Here's build
            <a href="https://github.com/facebook/conceal/tree/master/native/third-party/patches/">instructions</a>
            to do it yourself.

          <p>I think found a bug. How can I report it?</p>
          <p>
            We would really appreciate if you could either submit an issue or even better
            submit a pull request on
            <a href="http://facebook.github.io/conceal/">Github</a>.

          <p>I think found a security vulnerability. How can I report it?</p>
